Me: All the information that needs to be accessed by participants in one place. In a way that's not, like, visually tight and overwhelming. Yeah. Like, being it super accessible. Dude, I don't know if these mushrooms are making me more tired. Like, should the lion's man be waking me up? Maybe there's sugars or something putting me in sleep. Is there lines on there? I'm telling you one I'm just one. I do. So I just hate napping when it's light outside. Maybe I should nap from 04:30 to 05:30. Walk in from 05:30 to 08:30. Where are we going tonight? What? Where are we going It's well, I kinda swapped it because Zach asked for a favor. So I swapped two different day because Zach basically was like, we use the same bot to book the reservations for, like, these really nice restaurants that are impossible to get reservations at. Then Danielle got the flu, and they never did any Valentine's thing. So he was like, oh, can I swap it? And take the Saturday one? Oh, okay. Yeah. Because they, like, didn't get a Valentine's thing. So now we have the Wednesday one for this Wednesday. Yeah. Does that work? Do you wanna go somewhere tonight? Do it. Okay. Did that actually happen, or we're reserving for in a while? No. Like, she actually got sick. So they couldn't go. To their Wednesday one. So we called and moved their Wednesday one for the next Wednesday. And then our Saturday they took the Saturday one. These are random kids in our photo. How did he make even meet them? Where's Where's get others guess where? How's it going? Pretty good. Filling out the issue. What the fuck? Jesus fuck. It's hot. I'm so confused for a second. Building up the issue tree and knowing a refactor. They kill you, Ray? Keep killing him. Play this game. Keep No. Not now. Who is he pushing? So Jeremy So hard. Someone grew his hair. He's on the mix now. Yeah. That's what I was saying. Like Yeah. Before. And the k went stupid, bro. I couldn't tell whose hair it was in the back. They win? Pisses? Friday. Yeah. Fuck. They're, like, forty two and nine. With some slating cures. What if if you gave it the the source code for the old job form? Mhmm. And what are you doing since? Creating an issue structure. So that you can create issues to get so that any changes we make are tracked and done in short little phases. And did you ask it to generate this issue structure using a system prompt? No. I have a custom one. That I put in. It references, like, exactly how much context the tools of today have. And how to use, like, plan files. So the agent knows how to do this. And you know which model you're using? You were just shifting through? Is that only a droid thing? No? Yeah. Droid offers. Like, to her providers. Like, in Claude Cove, it wouldn't make sense for them to offer. Codex, would it? No. But, like, how do I know a movie's on Opus? I just don't. Slash mall. Okay. Understood. If Oh, hi, Bear. You know what his name was? Miss Westercase? Yeah. Then we shot him. Okay. Nah. It'd be tough to kill a bear if you domesticate him. What's going on today? Let me see.

Me: Sucked. And  
Them: And  
Me: every  
Them: every they the whole company just follows what he says in terms of, like,  
Me: the whole thing just follows.

Me: For AI. For tech and stuff like that.  
Them: And he was like,  
Me: And he would like I'm like, why?  
Them: I'm not gonna lie, in terms of like immediate bread, he was like, yeah, I'm trying he's trying to solve massive like change to the company.

Me: But yeah.  
Them: But yeah. He said he needed a whole  
Me: He's a he's at all. He wanted to make the whole team  
Them: he wanna replace the whole team with agents. Just didn't know how to do that. He went to Harvard the whole  
Me: heard replace the whole team with Asians.  
Them: team with a whole bunch of Liz's. Just everybody. Just a whole bunch of a no. It's bad. Bro, they called Liz yesterday in the car. Reed's that Liz was a sleeper agent. Isn't that crazy? What? Do I do now? Not a Aisnder agent. I feel like if you maybe you tell her, like, a couple of or you tell her, like, I don't know, like, what was the call with the what's it?  
Me: No. You're right, bro. She's an agent. She just needs, like, good prompter. Structure, bro. Like, really gotta prompt engineer that.  
Them: Say, like,  
Me: Say, like, you know, you know, there. Was like really just an agent with bad context,  
Them: Hiroshima. You know what I'm saying? It's like, come to life.  
Me: management. Right? High high high agency high initiative.  
Them: Okay.  
Me: Very low conducts with it.

Me: Which is horrible with confidence.  
Them: That's all it is.  
Me: Got context. She Dementia.  
Them: Right.  
Me: Context. Context. Context. Context. Context.  
Them: What is happening? Why is my CrocNet installing?  
Me: So will be cool. Reason two things. Guess, one is he's only been at New York Life for three months, so I was wondering Yeah.  
Them: Yes.  
Me: If he told you much about that. Yeah.  
Them: Yes. He moves the other company he was at was moving too slow. He was trying to implement more changes. More AI changes, and they were like and they said the money for that they said they were gonna invest mad bread, but he said they  
Me: Because  
Them: they weren't gonna do that for two years. And  
Me: it's a fucking sustainability start up. They move slow. Sustainability. Unless you're actually like because they're like a sustainability company, not like a startup. You know?  
Them: Right.  
Me: Right.  
Them: And they, like, they just moved to computers, like, six years ago. That's what he said.  
Me: They like, they got you. Computers. Said.  
Them: 2016 2018 is when they moved to computers. Which is crazy. Is there you're looking at the flicks?  
Me: In Bro, this ain't We're  
Them: Where's the flakes?  
Me: I mean, there's a shit out of them, Jack.  
Them: Where's the place? Oh, let's go. I'm gonna click on that.  
Me: You're wonderful with your I made it, brother.  
Them: Shared albums is one of the best things ever.  
Me: It really is, bro. Am I in any of these? No. Because the other ones are on, like, big camera, and so they gotta upload those.  
Them: Almost  
Me: Oh, okay.  
Them: Almost as good as shared circles. Let me see. Oh,  
Me: Spills his drink. This one. That was me. That was me. Threw that. Look. Look. Look.  
Them: Guys, that's so awesome.  
Me: Look.  
Them: This is so awesome. Oh my gosh. This picture of you and Reese, And Tiana and Liz is amazing. I love this picture. I'm gonna save it.  
Me: But okay. So he's been there he's been there three months. I guess I'm interested in, like, how much, you know, he could be a champion, but how does he can he really move them to take action? It'll be interesting. So he worked at Total Energies. That's legit.  
Them: Is that legit?  
Me: He was six years of total energies.  
Them: Is that legit?  
Me: For total energies?  
Them: No idea.  
Me: Know what that is? Bro, look at Total Energies real quick. Oh,  
Them: Oh my gosh. They have me shotgunning. That's awesome. Dude, what a shitty shotgun.  
Me: I have one shitty shotgun the whole day, There's an engineer at Total Energy. So definitely a smart guy.  
Them: Your phone is using the same Wi Fi as a Mac Mini.  
Me: You're talking  
Them: Then Expo Go opens the app, and your phone scans your QR code. Okay. No way. There's a video of that. Note No. This is so what a great shred album, bro.  
Me: Well, yeah, look. He looks makes me look bad. No. Yeah. Then you got caught and immediately moved out. Well,  
Them: Wait. Where? I wanna see it too.  
Me: Dude, I really gotta go through all of these. I gotta see the audio too now, bro.  
Them: Where Wow. So awesome. Yo. I  
Me: Okay.  
Them: No. We sit here with the generator kick. I'm not gonna lie. We should. Resit. Resit. Resit. The the the last thing that's important. Is  
Me: Oh, wow.  
Them: this guy, he he talks a lot. So I said I would send him a doc of, like, of, like, the, like, questions and stuff like that. He can stay because literally he's just talking the whole time. You know what I'm saying?  
Me: What was he done?  
Them: So  
Me: So, like, he jabbed himself?  
Them: entrepreneurship and business frameworks Like, his whole thing is, like, taking the business frameworks from the nerds and bringing it to the higher level people. It's making making decisions that combined He's just talking about his lessons from HBS, from Harvard Business School. And taking lessons and frameworks that he learned and implementing them into the real life, but at a fast rate. Like, he's like, these people move slow. What is that gonna do moving slow? How is that gonna really help? Know what I'm saying? Like, technology is moving so fast. What kept saying. Tech is moving fast. Tech is moving fast. And he's a nine out of 10. He said that HBO the Harvard Business School has been to three categories, people that do like, the consulting, McKinsey type of individuals. The people that are like the finance pros, and then the people that are the tech pros. And but he's like, p they can't communicate to each other. He's like, he's really good at the finance, he's really good at the consulting. But he's like a six out of 10 on attack. And then that's what was saying. That makes sense?  
Me: Mhmm.  
Them: Okay. And then the last thing he said that was really that was really awesome was he has this guy that was best friends with one of his friends, was best friends with Elon. And the guy left his he the guy his okay. So  
Me: So  
Them: the guy the guy's friend was best friends with Elon. And so  
Me: who is Fred? This guy's friend's friend?  
Them: yes. Conan's friend Conan's friend started a startup  
Me: But  
Them: but his friend but start Conan's friend started a start up. And he left SpaceX to start the startup. And he was, like, Elon's guy. Like, he was Elon's guy But the reason he left SpaceX was because he want to do more with nuclear fusion. On the moon and setting up nuclear spots on the moon. But Elon wasn't for that. Like, Elon's for that, but Elon said that Elon was focused on a whole bunch of different directions. That that's why the guy left. He left about two years ago. Multi millionaire mad bread. Mad resources. And he says that the guy is really mean. But he said that he's super duper breaded and just needs help, needs team help, but nobody wants to work for the guy. But at the same but the no. The people come and they work for him, but then they get fired because people aren't able to move on their own. Guy that people has to keep telling people what to do, and he says he hates that. And so the guy's looking for a whole bunch of agents to come in and and he has a fat bag. He's like, I have a whole bunch of agents that need to be built because these people suck. He was like, that's the guy that after our call that I can connect you to because that's literally one of my closest friends. And the guy's best friends with Elon, and he has mad bread. And your agents that you're talking about, and I told him, like, our pictures of the build a thon at the generator showed him pictures of us, Spencer. I showed him pictures of, like, our guys and stuff like that. And I was like, yes. I told him about about I didn't tell him about I told him about some about the enterprise work that you that you do. I told him more about Atlas. And I told him about prop process, obviously, but I told him about, like, Atlas. Know, I'm like, people are being replaced. Like, people are being replaced. Witty woo, blah blah blah. And it's it's really for people that, like, CEOs that need that need a whole bunch of team You know what I'm saying? I have a whole I need a whole bunch of team. But at the same time, struggle to come in and aren't and need to replicate what they're doing. They need more time. Know what I'm saying? And, like, as a CEO myself, like, if I could make another Joshua, that would be amazing. But that infrastructure wasn't possible before but now there's tools that can make that more possible. He's like, oh my god. Like, this guy would bro. And he was glazing. He was like, oh my god. Like, that guy that's perfect. That's exactly what he needs. And he's a eight figure, nine figure dude. He said, I don't know if he's eight or nine figures, but got bread. That's what he was like. I said, you know, bread. You you have to talk to him. That's what he said. Yeah. So, yeah. That's all from the bus, gang. That's all from the bus. Isn't that crazy? Yes, bro.  
Me: Should we talk to Eli or no? Eli Paulica?  
Them: Who's Eli?  
Me: For a dozen glass?  
Them: So yeah. We About what?  
Me: Well, he I don't know. He's an AI consult he started as an intern and now he's an AI consultant He built, like, an agent or two. But he works in New York Life.  
Them: You know, I worked at New York Life?  
Me: Yeah. Over the summer.  
Them: So he the guy the guy probably knows Eli then.  
Me: Summer. Summer. Well,  
Them: Because he's like, this is the people guy in your play.  
Me: Eli's low key been there longer than him. And but Eli, you know, Eli's our age, so it's like  
Them: Right.  
Me: Right. But, know,  
Them: Right.  
Me: started He did an internship as a corporate intern in May 2024. So junior summer.  
Them: I'm happy to help you. I love you, love you.  
Me: And then  
Them: Eli was the first person I went out with that absence.  
Me: Or no. Wait. No. I'm sorry. That was sophomore summer. Yeah. Right? Yeah. And then junior summer, last summer, he did part time internship as a field operations value stream intern. And pitched in the AI innovation pitch challenge they have developed an AI powered portfolio review agent that reduced portfolio check time by 86%. And now he's a part time AI consultant with them.  
Them: Tough.  
Me: Which means he's probably gonna be one of the most valuable people and he's gonna work there.  
Them: Cough.  
Me: Going forward.

Them: No, gang. I was I was talking to my clawed bot. On the phone. I didn't even realize that if I unplugged my Mac, that clawbot wouldn't run. Mom, what time are we leaving? Okay. Beth, I I was talking to my club on the phone. He's like, oh, what are you working You know what I'm saying? So, yeah, that's what happened. Just talk. And then he said Harvard Business School I was like, oh, okay. Didn't say it out loud. You know what I'm saying? But I was like I made a mental note. I was like,  
Me: You got you got a yes.  
Them: you know,  
Me: He is a HBS computer science certification on his profile from 2020 as well.  
Them: This man bent on the cut. K.  
Me: It's good. It's probably gonna be easier to talk to than most people.  
Them: Yes. He was a good he was but he was a yapper. He was a yapper, though.  
Me: About I know how to wrangle yabber.  
Them: Let's be clear. Alright.  
Me: Now senator type yabber, that filibuster type yabber, they got no fucking money, and then all this shit happen.  
Them: Yes. Yes.  
Me: Yeah. Can't do much with that. But, you know, enterprise, yep. That's let's get shit done. Yeah. That's I like that.  
Them: Yes. That's exactly Exactly. Exactly.  
Me: People. Yeah.  
Them: Right.  
Me: Still, like, let's go to the bar and get a deal signed.  
Them: Okay. Exactly. And he got he wants to make sure have  
Me: Son.  
Them: He said he said they just invested 10,000,000,000. Into AI and they're trying to figure out what how to deploy it properly. They keep hiring these people I saw.  
Me: Yeah. That's  
Them: Right.  
Me: Yeah. Company? Oh my god. Gosh. You can be could be wrong. That could be a little I can be a 10 k finder fee. I could be a $50.15 k finder fee. Like, who knows what could be? Knows what this could turn into? It could be a co lead project. Could be anything. I don't know. She's got  
Them: This is kinda ABS, you know, always be selling. Just trying to keep the pipeline full.  
Me: Enjoy your  
Them: That's  
Me: family time and tell your sister the whole dinner  
Them: I pulled over there.  
Me: Heavy.  
Them: Yes. Well, that's a special. It says happy birthday.  
Me: No. Who generated? That's just Spencer. Me  
Them: She says thank you. She's Oh, the whole the whole generator who I meant to say, the whole generator, Alex I'm saying? Everybody say happy birthday.  
Me: And you begin the last name right, Big Dug.  
Them: Man, you know, Alex, I know you gang. You know what I'm saying? What am I? A newbie? You know what I mean? I know you're still in court. Okay. Hey. Safety. I'll see you all soon.  
Me: It's That's pretty funny. I know that The other side. Okay. Now let's talk. Issue creation. There's no issue. Create. And Actually? Enter. So we can build. Let me So first, For this Tuesday's meeting, do you wanna Actually, I think we'll base it off of how the Monday meeting goes. We'll get an update from. I think I we got we got a ballistic team. That's what I'm saying, bro. I was talking with Spiegel, like, the whole idea would be we get rid of tech team, we start, like, the second tier of the generator being, like, not a team of the core because, like, right now we have this broad, like, base all focused on accessibility and growing the community. Mhmm. Need that second tier of, like, the the builders. And, But what are they working on? Besides just, like, actively building on their own shit? Well, that's it would be a project. It would be like a project thing. Kinda like how Olin had like teams, like built something over the semester. They would build like four or five, like, bigger projects together. And we'd have to, like, decide those at the start of of the year for our son. Okay. And what was the what was the benefit of that besides just, like, giving them technical experience? And, like, an playfield. Mhmm. What's the benefit? That they can build stuff. And the benefit is gonna be based on what the project is, though. Okay. Like, with it could be something like the TRI program like that. If we could get it locked in, Mhmm. And we have the team to actually execute it. Is totally viable. Right. Sam's not a doer, though. Mhmm. Hate that kid. I know. Just one more straw, and he's fucking out of here. I'm like, what? Broched it up to the cafe madly and then ate all my oranges. Dude texted me this morning saying, hey, dude. Do you know what time photo shoot is? I have two finals back to back. Money word for it finals, Monday, Tuesday. I, like, probably can't make it and then he just rolls in latest fucking just sits there. I'm not studying. And he was supposed to be violently sick, but he couldn't come to retreat. Saw him yesterday. He was chilling. I saw him day out. He was chilling. I saw him today chilling. Was now sick. Oh, he's just bullshit. He doesn't like doing shit. Yeah. To the right It's interesting. No. We don't need to harden off that much. You hear that, Granola? Alex said he hates Sam Spiegel. You can right now. You have granola running right now with the butt. Yeah. I told you we're gonna be running Granola to go through the issues. Oh, wait. Don't worry. I'm not in Madrid. We're not doing all that bullshit. No, Mo. That shit was so much drama. Too much drama. Drama llama. Alright. Jeff Formers. I do hate saying I speak a little Ocean. Facts. I hate Sam Spiegel too. What'd you hop for? The job for events, theme, and track selection. Move themes. There's Yep. Do you have some? I don't think the tools I know is too It's what? But if it's free if it's free form, does it waste any time? No. But does it get full Does it really get fed back in? To the matchmaking? At all. Because the current sugar Oh, like, gonna be like this. Why cut it back? If people filled it out before? Let's go ahead, Yeah. Yeah. No. No. Second one. Second one. My bad. Only block partial teams from gaming matching. A good question. Strip down. Yeah. Right? Strip down. Alright. So that'll handle the first block. Of issues. Only other thing I was gonna do is have it pull the general event schedule. And I need to repeat Eric in that He looks like a high schooler, bro. You're in a bitch. Wow. That's such a clear photo. William Stanford, kid. And I'll have to pull images too. Yeah? From this code base? Mhmm. Do we need them, though? Yes. Sorry. Because what I want is that we're gonna have Ryan's build upon video. Mhmm. Two. I should be somewhere. Yeah. Mhmm. So this is gonna push issues to get So then, basically, all you'll do I have a system prompt. There it's a very small prompt. It's not really a system prompt. It's a prompt Yeah. That you point an agent at Uh-huh. So you open a fresh clogged code instance each time. For each issue so that it like, fill up its context. Yeah. It's really one agent focused on one specific task. Okay. You paste the prompt that primes it to read the files it needs. And it starts working on the issue. Then you have codex, review it, review its work, Clean up any dead coat, lease bond. And you push. And once, you know, you go one by one or you can run issues one through four from you know, in sequence and issues four through 10 in sequence so they don't override each other. And then, yeah, that'll be it. We'll get it done. So, really, the other things are photos, for background, We need an video embedding window. Right? Mhmm. The ban I would say this generator logo banner. This important registration information is important. Right? The display, I would say. And then the tool stack as well. Right? Or no? Still recommend the same one? I mean, we could cut back some. A lot. But yeah. We would cut back We would take out Azure Honestly, I would take out Lovable because people know about it. Like, like, we don't need these three. These are kinda no brainers. You know what I mean? Mhmm. I would definitely leave most of these These are great. There's way more I can put it into. We could expand this like crazy. Now that I've done it for g 1,000, I have giant repositories of them. In PDF and Google Docs. Specifically, just like a the one I made for June 1000 just has, like, hundreds of git repos that are free. Which I think is, increase the build quality a lot. You good with that? You think it's makes sense to put all that stuff live on the site on its own page like this? Yeah. Yeah. I'll go with that. I'll just make it more sectionable. Just have, like, a drop down for, like, are you looking for a repo, or you looking for, like, tool? Yeah. If you wanna sort. Do we want the WhatsApp button? Yeah. Or should that be the Discord? Because Jonathan wants to be a Discord. Right? Discord. Discord should be the primary one. WhatsApp should be, like, somewhere else. Mhmm. Yeah. Okay. So those three buttons should remain, but just go ahead instead of one sec. Have a schedule button. Prizes button. Resources button. Tracks button. Do you wanna also do one with, like, judges or keynote? Because we're not doing keynotes. Do judge judge is important or Just keep him hidden. Sponsors is what we need. Sponsors and per and judging. Sections? Judging is maybe. We can make a side. So this I think we simplify the top bar. Yeah. Then have a side menu that's like actually more informative. What do you think? A clean and like, the things that aren't in the top bar are in the sidebar. So we have a top bar that maybe just says about prizes, sponsor, schedule, or schedule sponsors. Well well, low key we could put prom. I'm just thinking about prizes and sponsors. We could put as, like, oh, we could put it as one section, but not really. I just don't want it to be, like, prizes. They're not coming from certain sponsors. But yes. Yeah. I know. That's exactly why. Yeah. We don't wanna do that per se. Yeah. What would be on the sidebar? Like judging. Resources, AI tools. I think top really because we're not gonna have tracks here. Right? No. Mean, you can scroll. It's just gonna be about prizes, sponsors, Excuse me. Schedule. Okay. So four at the top bar. Will be better. And then register now. So five. And then on the left, it'll be judging rubric resources, Resources and all the tools there. They're different. These tools that I can do. Sort of same thing. Just the. But I'm not saying we put don't know if we should This is too crowded. No? Yeah. Like, on on mobile, it looked ass. Yeah. So we need to dial back the hero section for sure. It's hard to read all that crap. And I don't like, I we're not doing this, like, ugly card layout. Like, again, like, we're what you have is clean already, and we're gonna keep keep it away from doing the ugly card layout.
